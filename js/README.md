### saara

A module that adds an element at the second index in an ordered array. Works immutably. JS implementation is currently available. Supports also adding an element to the second-to-last index.

## Usage

Insert item into second index of an array
```
    var newArray = saaraize(item, array)
```

Insert item into second-to-last index of an array
```
    var newArray = saaraVisionize(item, array)
```

## Future work

* Add UMK-mode, which adds an element into the first, second and third indices.
* Support Immutable JS
* Just Clojure It
